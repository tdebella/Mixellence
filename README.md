## The Task / Challenge

- In 30 days with a group of two create a single-page react application, consisting 4 pages (client/home & admin/dashboard).

   - [x] Create store with redux/toolkit
   - [x] Create backend and authentication with Firebase
   - [x] Add data and user to mock database with Firebase

## Link

   - Live Site URL: [Mixellence](https://mixellence-67ae5.web.app/)

## The process

- We discussed and decided early on that we were going to create the repository and all packages necessary to build the site. <br/>

- We used redux/redux toolkits to build the store and Firebase for the backend and authentication.   

- This is a web app built using

   - HTML5
   - CSS3
   - Module CSS
   - CSS Flexbox
   - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
   - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
   - [React Router v6.3](https://reactrouter.com/)
   - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) & [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
   - Firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/)

- Lessons learned:
   - We met the designer & looked at the design together. We  had enough time to ask questions and discuss the functions of certain features. 
   - Working with a good designer can be a great experience. We took the opportunity to learn some new tools (e.g., figma) and clientâ€™s requirements.
   - We learnt how to collaborate & use the git/github.com (code push/pull, resolved merge conflict, etc...) while building the project in a team.
