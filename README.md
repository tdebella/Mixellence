## Our process

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router v6.3](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) & [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

We discussed and decided early on that we were going to create the repository and all packages necessary to build the site. We used redux/redux toolkits to build the store and firebase for backend and authentication.
